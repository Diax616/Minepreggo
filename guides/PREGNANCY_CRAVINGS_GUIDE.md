## Overview

During pregnancy, players and mobs experience cravings for specific types of foods. These cravings are categorized by flavor profile and are specific to the species being carried. Eating the right type of food to satisfy active cravings provides gratification that reduces the craving meter.

### Key Concepts

- **Craving Types** - Four flavor categories: Sweet, Salty, Sour, and Spicy
- **Species-Specific Foods** - Different foods are more effective for different species
- **Gratification Values** - Each food provides different amounts of satisfaction
- **Penalties** - Some foods are less effective when used for wrong species pregnancies
- **Phase 1+** - Cravings become active during Phase 1 (P1) of pregnancy

## Gratification Mechanics

### How Gratification Works

**Gratification Value:**
- Each food has a specific gratification number (4-20 range typically)
- This value represents how much a food satisfies a craving
- Higher values = more satisfaction from one consumption

**Craving Meter:**
- Cravings have an internal meter that starts at a certain level
- Consuming matching craving foods decreases the meter
- When meter reaches zero, the craving is satisfied and removed

**Penalty Multiplier:**
- Different foods have different effectiveness for different species
- **Human foods for humans:** 0.1x penalty (normal effectiveness)
- **Species-specific foods for that species:** 0.1x-0.2x penalty (slightly reduced but still effective)
- **Wrong species foods:** Higher penalty, less effective

### Examples

**Example 1: Human Craving - Sweet**
- Chocolate Bar (Human): 20 gratification at 0.1x penalty = 2 gratification reduction
- Would need 10 chocolates to fully satisfy a 20-point craving

**Example 2: Zombie Craving - Sweet**
- Brain with Chocolate (Zombie): 20 gratification at 0.2x penalty = 4 gratification reduction
- More effective than human foods would be
- Would need 5 brains to fully satisfy the same 20-point craving

**Example 3: Creeper Craving - Spicy**
- Activated Gunpowder with Hot Sauce (Creeper): 8 gratification at 0.1x penalty = 0.8 gratification
- Less efficient than specialized foods
- Using human Hot Chicken would be even less effective

## Craving Satisfaction Tips

### Best Practices

1. **High-Gratification Foods:** Use foods with highest gratification values first
   - Chocolate Bar (20) for human sweet
   - Brain with Chocolate (20) for zombie sweet
   - These require fewest consumptions

2. **Species-Appropriate Foods:** Use foods designed for the species
   - Zombies: Use brain items (more effective)
   - Creepers: Use activated gunpowder items
   - Humans: Use regular food items

3. **Stockpile Variety:** Have multiple options for each craving type
   - Different gratification values for different situations
   - Backup options if primary not available

4. **Plan Pregnancies:** Know which species pregnancies expect which cravings
   - Stock appropriate foods before pregnancy
   - Reduces stress during cravings

5. **Early Supply:** Build supplies before becoming pregnant
   - Don't want to search for food while managing pregnancy
   - Reduces complications and complications

### During Pregnancy

**When a Craving Appears:**
1. Player receives visual indicator (varies by mod config)
2. Craving type is specified (Sweet, Salty, Sour, or Spicy)
3. Craving meter shows satisfaction level
4. Eating matching food reduces the meter
5. When meter empties, craving is satisfied

**Benefits of Satisfaction:**
- Removes the craving effect
- Reduces stress/discomfort
- Allows focusing on other pregnancy management
- Provides satisfaction mechanic engagement

**Consequences of Ignoring:**
- Craving persists and becomes stronger
- May cause discomfort effects
- Can impact pregnancy progression
- Player experience becomes more challenging

## Advanced Information

### Penalty Factors Explained

**Human Foods:**
- **For Human pregnancies:** 0.1x penalty = highly effective
- **For Zombie pregnancies:** 0.1x penalty = acceptable but less ideal
- **For Creeper pregnancies:** 0.1x penalty = not recommended

**Species-Specific Foods:**
- **Brain items:** 0.2x penalty when used for zombie pregnancies
- **Gunpowder items:** 0.1x penalty when used for creeper pregnancies
- More specialized = sometimes slightly less effective but more flavorful

**Cross-Species Usage:**
- Can use any food for any pregnancy type
- But penalties make wrong species less satisfying
- Encourages collecting species-appropriate varieties

### Nutritional Properties

All craving foods provide actual nutrition when consumed:

**Typical Values:**
- Nutrition: 2-8 hunger points restored
- Saturation: 0.1f-0.4f saturation modifier
- Some foods are "always eat" (can eat when full)

This means satisfying cravings also restores hunger!
