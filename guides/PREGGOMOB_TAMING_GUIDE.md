## How to Tame a Preggomob

### Requirements

To tame a preggomob in survival mode, you will need:
1. **Species-Specific Food Item** (see table below)
2. The preggomob to be present in the world
3. An interaction (right-click with the food)

### Species-Specific Taming Foods

| Species | Taming Food | How to Obtain |
|---------|-------------|---------------|
| Zombie Girl | **Villager Brain** | Crafted from zombie drops, or obtained through other means |
| Humanoid Creeper Girl | **Activated Gunpowder** | Crafted from gunpowder (dropped by creepers) |

### Taming Process

**Step 1: Locate a Wild Preggomob**
- Find a wild/untamed Zombie Girl or Humanoid Creeper Girl
- These are typically found spawning naturally in the world
- They will be hostile when approached

**Step 2: Gather the Correct Taming Food**
- For Zombie Girls: Craft **Villager Brain** items
- For Creeper Girls: Hunt creepers, craft gunpowder into **Activated Gunpowder**
- Ensure you have at least one of the correct item

**Step 3: Right-Click with the Taming Food**
- Approach the preggomob while holding the taming food
- Right-click on the preggomob with the correct food item in your hand
- If successful, the preggomob will be tamed and converted
- The food item may be consumed in the process

### What Happens After Taming

When a preggomob is successfully tamed:

1. **Entity Conversion**
   - The wild preggomob converts into a domesticated version
   - For example: MonsterZombieGirl → TamableZombieGirl

2. **Ownership**
   - The preggomob becomes YOUR companion
   - It recognizes you as its owner
   - Other players cannot command it (depends on server settings)

3. **Property Transfer**
   - All properties transfer to the tamed version:
     - Health (current health status)
     - Name (if you named it)
     - Inventory (items it was carrying)
     - Current targets (if it was fighting something)
     - Equipment (armor, tools, weapons)

4. **Behavior Change**
   - The preggomob becomes **non-hostile**
   - It will no longer attack you on sight
   - It becomes docile and manageable

5. **New Capabilities**
   - The tamed preggomob gains breeding capabilities
   - It can now produce offspring
   - It has a fertility system
   - It can become pregnant
