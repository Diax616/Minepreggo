## Tips for Advancement Hunters

**Pregnancy Methods Matter!**

- The dragon-related advancements are the most challenging and rewarding (200 XP for Give Birth a Dragon!)
- Complete all three prenatal checkups during one of your pregnancies to unlock "Good Mother"

- For "Give Birth By All Species," you'll need to experience 6 different pregnancies
- For "Impregnate All Species," male players need to find and interact with all 4 impregnable entity types

**Advancement Triggers:**

- Birth advancements trigger when you reach the final phase and complete delivery
- Checkup advancements require actually performing the medical procedures with a doctor
