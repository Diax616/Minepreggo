## Overview

Ender Dragon pregnancy is one of the most powerful and unique pregnancy types in the mod. As you carry the offspring of the legendary Ender Dragon, you'll gain increasingly powerful buffs and abilities that mirror the strength and nature of the End's most fearsome creature. By the final phase, you'll wield devastating powers including teleportation and the ability to shoot explosive fireballs.

- **Mystical Ender Powers:** Teleportation and explosive fireballs in advanced phases
- **Visual Effects:** Purple portal particles that increase with pregnancy progression
- **Immunity Effects:** Protection from fire, poison, and wither damage
- **Dragon Recognition:** Endermen become allies who fight for you in later phases
- **Increased Metabolism:** Causes significantly more hunger drain than other pregnancies (40% increased exhaustion)
- **Mitigation Options:** Metabolism Control potion can help reduce the hunger effect

## How to Obtain Ender Dragon Pregnancy

Becoming pregnant with Ender Dragon offspring requires a complex brewing chain. This is intentionally challenging to reflect the power you'll gain. Here's the complete pathway:

### Step 1: Create Ender Impregnation Potions

**Recipe:**
- **Impregnation Potion** (any amplifier: 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4)
- **Ender Life Substance** (brewing ingredient)

**Process:** Add Ender Life Substance to any Impregnation Potion in a brewing stand.

**Result:** Randomly produces either:
- Monster Ender Impregnation (produces monster-type Ender Dragon offspring), OR
- Humanoid Ender Impregnation (produces humanoid-type Ender Dragon offspring)

Both retain the amplifier level of the original Impregnation Potion.

**Note:** The type (Monster or Humanoid) is randomly determined during brewing. Currently, there is no way to control which type you'll receive.

#### Obtaining Ender Life Substance

Crafting recipe (shapeless):
- 2x **Dead Ender Fetuses** (from killing pregnant Ender mobs)
- 2x **Ender Pearls** (from Endermen)
- 1x **Cum Specimen Tube** (crafted with Cum Specimen)

Result: 1x **Ender Life Substance**

### Step 2: Create Powerful Ender Impregnation Potions

**Recipe:**
- **Ender Impregnation Potion** (any type or amplifier from Step 1)
- **Concentrated Ender Life Substance** (brewing ingredient)

**Process:** Add Concentrated Ender Life Substance to any Ender Impregnation Potion in a brewing stand.

**Result:** A single consolidated **Ender Powerful Impregnation** potion with enhanced effects.

#### Crafting Concentrated Ender Life Substance

Combine these items in a crafting table (shapeless):
- 1x **Ender Life Substance**
- 1x **Refined Chorus Shards**
- 1x **Ender Breast Milk Bottle** ⚠️ **IMPORTANT: Rare ingredient!**

Result: 1x **Concentrated Ender Life Substance**

**How to Get Each Component:**

**Refined Chorus Shards:** Crafting recipe (shapeless)
- 1x **Popped Chorus Fruit** (from Chorus Plants in The End)
- 1x **Blaze Powder** (from Blazes)
- 1x **Gold Nugget** (from gold ore or Item frames)

**Ender Breast Milk Bottle:** ⚠️ **Special Acquisition**
- Can ONLY be obtained by milking a **tamed, pregnant Ender Woman** (pregnant monster)
- Requires her to reach late pregnancy phases with milk production active
- This is a time-consuming process that demands owning a pregnant Ender Woman
- No alternative sources exist—this is a gating mechanic to balance Ender Dragon pregnancy power

### Step 3: Create the Ultimate Ender Dragon Impregnation Potion

**Recipe:**
- **Ender Powerful Impregnation** (from Step 2)
- **Dragon Egg** (brewing ingredient)

**Process:** Add Dragon Egg to Ender Powerful Impregnation in a brewing stand.

**Result:** **Ender Dragon Impregnation** potion — the final form!

#### Obtaining Dragon Egg

- Located in **The End** after defeating the Ender Dragon
- Appears on top of the exit portal
- Only drops one per world (on first dragon defeat)
- Can be obtained by defeating the Ender Dragon again if you respawn it using 4 End Crystals on the obsidian pillars
- Alternatively, can be obtained from the Creative mode inventory

### Time Investment

Be aware that obtaining Ender Dragon Impregnation potion is a significant undertaking:
1. Hunt Endermen for pearls
2. Kill pregnant Ender Women for dead fetuses
3. Farm Chorus Fruits in The End
4. Hunt Blazes in the Nether
5. **Tame an Ender Woman and keep her pregnant to milk her**
6. Defeat the Ender Dragon

This multi-step process ensures that Ender Dragon pregnancy is a late-game achievement rather than an early-game advantage.

## Prerequisites and Challenges

Before you can achieve Ender Dragon pregnancy, understand the requirements and challenges:

### Required Resources

1. **Access to The End** - You must defeat the Ender Dragon at least once to access The End dimension
2. **Tamed Ender Woman** - You need to capture and tame a pregnant Ender Woman mob to milk her for Ender Breast Milk Bottle
3. **Enderman/Ender Pearls** - Hunt Endermen for pearls
4. **Nether access** - Required to hunt Blazes for Blaze Powder
5. **Dragon Egg** - Available after defeating the Ender Dragon

### Time Investment

The full brewing chain is intentionally gated to be mid-to-late game content:
- Taming and maintaining a pregnant Ender Woman takes significant time
- Gathering all raw materials across multiple dimensions is time-consuming
- Reaching the final Ender Dragon Impregnation potion can take hours of gameplay
- This reflects the immense power you're gaining

### Recommended Progression

1. Establish base in Overworld
2. Build Nether portal and explore Nether (for Blaze Powder)
3. Build End portal and explore The End (for Chorus Fruits and Ender Pearls)
4. Defeat Ender Dragon and collect Dragon Egg
5. Identify and tame an Ender Woman mob
6. Get her pregnant (through any impregnation method)
7. Maintain her pregnancy and collect milk as she progresses through phases
8. Gather remaining components (Ender Life Substance, etc.)
9. Execute the full brewing chain
10. Use the final Ender Dragon Impregnation potion on yourself

---

## Ender Dragon Recognition System

At Phase 7, you gain **Ender Dragon Recognition**, which fundamentally changes how Endermen and Ender Women interact with you.

### How It Works

**Passive Safety:**
- Looking directly at Endermen or Ender Women no longer angers them
- You can stare at them, walk up to them, or pass by them without triggering hostility
- This makes exploring the End and other dimensions much safer

**Defensive Bodyguards:**
- When any creature attacks you (except Ender Dragons), nearby Endermen and Ender Women within a 24-block radius will automatically come to your defense
- They will target and attack whoever hurt you
- If they're already targeting you when you gain this effect, they'll stop attacking you

**Offensive Allies:**
- When you attack an entity, nearby Endermen and Ender Women will join the fight
- They won't attack: other Endermen, Ender Women, Ender Dragons, or your tamed animals
- Everyone else is fair game for your Ender army

**Important Notes:**
- This does NOT affect Ender Dragon behavior—Ender Dragons remain hostile
- The effect only works with wild Endermen and Ender Women; they don't need to be tamed
- The 24-block radius creates a protective zone around you wherever you go
- Multiple Endermen can assist you simultaneously, creating a powerful fighting force

---

## Ender Power System

Starting at Phase 6, you gain access to the **Ender Power System**, which allows you to use special abilities powered by Ender energy.

### Ender Essence (Phase 6+)

**Teleportation Ability:**
- Target a block and teleport to its location
- Costs Ender Power energy per use
- Teleports you to 1 block above the target position
- Only works on solid ground (not water or air)
- Automatically adjusts vertical position to find solid ground below target
- Cannot be used while in labor
- Plays Enderman teleportation sounds

**Energy Management:**
- Monitor your Ender Power level (displayed in your HUD)
- If energy is too low, you'll receive a message: "Without ender energy"
- Recharge by consuming Ender-related items or waiting for natural regeneration

**Side Effect:**
- **Chorus Fruit Disabled:** Eating chorus fruit will no longer teleport you—the effect is completely canceled
- This applies to both Ender Essence (P6+) and Ender Dragon Essence (P8)

### Ender Dragon Essence (Phase 8)

**Explosive Fireball Ability:**
- Target a location to shoot an explosive dragon fireball
- Higher Ender Power cost than teleportation
- Fireball travels toward the target location at high speed
- Creates a powerful explosion on impact
- Deals damage to creatures and blocks in the blast radius
- Cannot be used while in labor
- Makes Ghast shooting sound when fired

**Tactical Uses:**
- Combat: Devastate groups of enemies from range
- Mining: Clear large areas (with caution)
- Defense: Protect your base from threats

---

## Visual Effects

Throughout your Ender Dragon pregnancy, you'll be surrounded by mystical purple portal particles that spawn around your body.

**Particle Behavior:**
- **Type:** Purple portal particles (same as Nether portal effect)
- **Pattern:** 2 particles spawn at random positions near your body
- **Movement:** Particles move in random directions with slight downward drift
- **Frequency:** Increases as pregnancy progresses
  - P0: Every 120 seconds
  - P1: Every 135 seconds
  - P2: Every 155 seconds
  - P3: Every 180 seconds
  - P4: Every 210 seconds
  - P5: Every 245 seconds
  - P6: Every 285 seconds
  - P7: Every 330 seconds
  - P8: Every 380 seconds

**Inactive Period:**
- After spawning, particles remain inactive for 110 seconds before the next cycle begins
- This creates a rhythmic breathing effect that becomes longer as pregnancy advances

## Tips and Strategies

### Early Phases (P0-P2)
- **Focus on combat:** Take advantage of your increased health and armor
- **Explore safely:** You're tougher but not invincible yet
- **Prepare for later phases:** Gather resources for when you gain powers

### Mid Phases (P3-P5)
- **Use your immunities:** You can now fight in the Nether without fire concerns
- **Night exploration:** Night Vision makes cave exploration much easier
- **Tank damage:** With Damage Resistance and immunities, you can take on tougher enemies
- **Adjust to slower movement:** Plan combat around your reduced speed
- **Manage increased hunger:** Keep food stocked or use Metabolism Control potions
  - Ender Dragon pregnancy consumes food faster than other pregnancy types
  - Drink Metabolism Control potions before long excursions
  - Consider setting up food farms near your base

### Advanced Phases (P6-P7)
- **Master teleportation:** Practice using your new mobility
  - Escape dangerous situations instantly
  - Reach high places without building
  - Travel quickly across your base
  - Note: Chorus fruit no longer works once you gain Ender Powers
- **Manage Ender Power:** Keep your energy high for emergencies
- **Leverage Dragon Recognition (P7):** Endermen become your bodyguards
  - Look at Endermen safely without angering them
  - They'll defend you when attacked
  - They'll attack your targets in combat
  - Creates a 24-block radius "Ender Guard" zone
- **Stack regeneration with healing:** You're now extremely hard to kill

### Ultimate Phase (P8)
- **Dominate combat:** You have maximum offensive and defensive capabilities
- **Use fireballs strategically:** High damage but costs significant energy
- **Combine abilities:** Teleport → Fireball → Teleport away for hit-and-run tactics
- **Boss fights:** You're now strong enough to take on major threats
- **Be cautious:** Your powers disable during labor, so plan accordingly

### Energy and Resource Management
- **Ender Breast Milk** recovers Ender Power faster when you have Ender effects
- **Don't spam abilities:** Both teleport and fireball cost energy
- **Teleportation is cheaper:** Use it more frequently than fireball
- **Keep reserves:** Always maintain enough energy for emergency teleportation
- **Food management:** Keep extra food in your hotbar due to increased hunger
- **Potion supply:** Carry Metabolism Control potions to reduce hunger drain during long adventures

### Combat Tactics
- **High Knockback Resistance:** You can't be knocked around easily, allowing aggressive melee
- **Teleport for positioning:** Get behind enemies or escape when surrounded
- **Fireball for groups:** Use explosive power against clustered enemies
- **Regeneration keeps you alive:** Your natural healing means you can sustain prolonged fights
- **Stack strength with weapons:** Your Strength II effect multiplies with good equipment
- **Endermen army (P7+):** Fight near Endermen to turn them into automatic bodyguards
  - They'll attack whatever you're fighting
  - They'll defend you when you're hurt
  - Position yourself near End portals or The End for maximum backup
- **Safe eye contact:** Look freely at Endermen for reconnaissance without risk

### Important Limitations
- **Labor restriction:** All Ender Powers are disabled when you're in labor
- **Energy costs:** Monitor your Ender Power level constantly
- **Movement speed penalty:** You're slower, so use teleportation for mobility
- **Attack speed penalty:** Time your attacks carefully
- **No chorus fruit:** Chorus fruit teleportation is disabled once you gain Ender Powers (P6+)

## Pregnancy Progression

### Duration
Following the standard pregnancy system in the mod, Ender Dragon pregnancy progresses through nine phases over time. The duration of each phase depends on your mod configuration settings.

### Phase Advancement
- Each phase automatically advances to the next after its duration expires
- Effects accumulate—you always keep benefits from previous phases
- Visual particle frequency increases with each phase
- New abilities unlock at specific phases (P6 and P8)

### Ending the Pregnancy
When you reach full term and deliver:
- A Baby Ender Dragon Block is produced
- All Ender Dragon pregnancy effects are removed
- You lose access to Ender Powers (teleportation and fireball)
- Portal particle effects cease
- All stat modifiers return to normal
- You can trade the Baby Ender Dragon Block with villagers for valuable rewards

---

## Compatibility with Other Systems

### Milk Production
- **Ender Breast Milk Bottles** are produced exclusively by milking tamed, pregnant Ender Women (pregnant mobs)
- These bottles provide enhanced benefits when consumed by players with Ender Essence or Ender Dragon Essence effects
- Required ingredient for crafting Concentrated Ender Life Substance (the critical gating item for Ender Dragon pregnancy)
- **Note:** Players carrying Ender Dragon pregnancies cannot produce Ender Breast Milk directly—you must maintain a separate tamed pregnant Ender Woman to milk

### Preggo Mobs and Ender Creatures
- Having **Ender Dragon Recognition** (Phase 7+) prevents Endermen and Ender Women from becoming hostile when you look at them
- Nearby Endermen and Ender Women (within 24 blocks) will fight alongside you in combat
- They function as temporary allies, attacking your enemies and defending you from attackers

### Baby Duplication
- Special interactions occur during baby duplication if you have Ender Dragon pregnancy

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: Can I choose between Monster or Humanoid Ender Impregnation?**  
A: Currently, no. The type is randomly determined during brewing. This is a known limitation that may be improved in future updates.

**Q: What happens if I die while pregnant with an Ender Dragon?**  
A: Follow the standard death mechanics for pregnant players as documented in the mod's pregnancy system.

**Q: Can I have multiple pregnancies at once?**  
A: This depends on your mod configuration and the general pregnancy system rules.

**Q: Do the Ender Powers work in other dimensions?**  
A: Yes! Teleportation and fireballs work in the Overworld, Nether, and End.

**Q: How much Ender Power do the abilities cost?**  
A: Teleportation has a base cost, and the Explosive Fireball has a higher base cost. The exact values depend on your mod's configuration.

**Q: Can I still use Ender Powers after giving birth?**  
A: No. Once you deliver the baby, all Ender Dragon pregnancy effects end, including the special powers.

**Q: What's the best phase for combat?**  
A: Phase 8 offers maximum personal power, but Phase 7 is excellent if you're fighting near Endermen (like in The End) since you gain both regeneration and Endermen allies. Phases 6-7 provide excellent balance between offense, defense, and mobility.

**Q: Can Ender Dragons hurt me?**  
A: Yes, you still take full damage from Ender Dragons. The Ender Dragon Recognition effect does not affect Ender Dragon behavior—it only affects Endermen and Ender Women.

**Q: Can I still use chorus fruit to teleport?**  
A: No. Once you gain Ender Essence (Phase 6+), chorus fruit teleportation is completely disabled. You must use your Ender Power teleportation ability instead.

**Q: Do Endermen attack for me even if I don't own them?**  
A: Yes! With Ender Dragon Recognition (P7+), any Endermen or Ender Women within 24 blocks will automatically defend you and attack your targets. They don't need to be tamed.

**Q: Why do I get so hungry during Ender Dragon pregnancy?**  
A: Ender Dragon pregnancy causes 40% increased metabolic exhaustion compared to base pregnancy exhaustion. This increases further with each pregnancy phase. It's a balance mechanic—the enormous power gains require more resources to sustain.

**Q: How can I reduce the hunger effect?**  
A: The Metabolism Control potion directly counters hunger by boosting your saturation levels. Brew it using Awkward Potion + Crimson or Warped Fungus. Higher amplifier levels provide greater hunger reduction. Always keep some in your inventory during Ender Dragon pregnancy.

**Q: Can I manage hunger without potions?**  
A: Yes, but you'll need to eat very frequently. Keep high-saturation foods (like golden carrots, steak, or cooked salmon) readily available. Metabolism Control potions are the most efficient solution though.

**Q: Why is the Ender Dragon Impregnation potion so complex to make?**  
A: The multi-step brewing chain exists to balance the enormous power you gain. Requiring a tamed pregnant Ender Woman (who must be milked over time) gatekeeps the final potion behind significant time investment, preventing it from being an easy early-game power spike. This is intentional design.

**Q: Can I get Ender Breast Milk Bottle any other way?**  
A: No. It can exclusively be obtained by milking a tamed, pregnant Ender Woman. This is the critical bottleneck preventing Ender Dragon pregnancy from being easily accessible. Plan ahead and maintain a pregnant Ender Woman if you want to pursue this path.

**Q: What happens if my tamed Ender Woman goes into labor before I milk her?**  
A: She'll deliver her offspring and you lose the opportunity to milk her for that pregnancy. Milk her before labor begins, or you'll need to get her pregnant again.

**Q: Do I need multiple Ender Dragon Impregnation potions?**  
A: Only one is needed to become pregnant with a Dragon once. However, if you want multiple pregnancies or to retry with a different amplifier level, you'll need to complete the brewing chain again. Plan your Ender Breast Milk Bottle supply accordingly.

## Conclusion

Ender Dragon pregnancy transforms you into one of the most powerful entities in Minecraft, granting devastating abilities that mirror the might of the legendary Ender Dragon. From humble beginnings with increased health and armor, you'll eventually command the power to teleport across the battlefield and rain explosive destruction upon your enemies.

The path to this power comes with a cost: your metabolism skyrockets, requiring careful food management. However, with proper planning, Metabolism Control potions, and strategic resource gathering, you can sustain yourself while enjoying being the most formidable pregnant player in your world.

Use these powers wisely, manage your Ender Power and hunger carefully, and enjoy the incredible journey of carrying the Ender Dragon's offspring. Just remember—all powers fade during labor, so plan your adventures accordingly!

Happy dragon carrying!
