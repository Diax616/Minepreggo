## Pregnancy Delay Potion

### What It Does

The Pregnancy Delay potion slows down the progression of pregnancy. It adds extra days to the pregnancy, pushing back the due date when the mother will give birth.

### How It Works

**Effect Type:** Instantaneous (applies immediately upon contact)

**Delay Amount:** Based on the potion's power level:
- **Level 0:** Adds 15-20% of total pregnancy days
- **Level 1:** Adds 20-25% of total pregnancy days
- **Level 2:** Adds 25-30% of total pregnancy days
- **Level 3:** Adds 30-35% of total pregnancy days
- **Level 4:** Adds 35-40% of total pregnancy days

### Example

If a pregnancy normally lasts 100 days:
- A Level 0 Pregnancy Delay might add 15-20 extra days (making it 115-120 days total)
- A Level 4 Pregnancy Delay might add 35-40 extra days (making it 135-140 days total)

### Who Uses It

- Fertility Witches throw this potion randomly
- Can be brewed through the alchemy system
- Useful for those wanting to extend pregnancy duration

### Effects on Phases

The potion adds time to the current pregnancy phase, potentially delaying progression to the next phase of development.

## Pregnancy Acceleration Potion

### What It Does

The Pregnancy Acceleration potion speeds up the progression of pregnancy. It reduces the time remaining until birth by advancing through pregnancy phases faster.

### How It Works

**Effect Type:** Instantaneous (applies immediately upon contact)

**Acceleration Amount:** Based on the potion's power level:
- **Level 0:** Accelerates by 15-20% of total pregnancy days
- **Level 1:** Accelerates by 20-25% of total pregnancy days
- **Level 2:** Accelerates by 25-30% of total pregnancy days
- **Level 3:** Accelerates by 30-35% of total pregnancy days
- **Level 4:** Accelerates by 35-40% of total pregnancy days

### Example

If a pregnancy normally lasts 100 days:
- A Level 0 Pregnancy Acceleration might remove 15-20 days (making it 80-85 days total)
- A Level 4 Pregnancy Acceleration might remove 35-40 days (making it 60-65 days total)

### Who Uses It

- Fertility Witches throw this potion randomly
- Can be brewed through the alchemy system
- Useful for those wanting to shorten pregnancy duration

### Effects on Phases

The potion advances through the current pregnancy phase, potentially moving to the next phase of development sooner.

## Baby Duplication Potion

### What It Does

The Baby Duplication potion increases the number of babies in a pregnancy. It adds additional offspring to the current pregnancy, allowing mothers to carry more babies.

### How It Works

**Effect Type:** Instantaneous (applies immediately upon contact)

**Babies Added:** Based on the potion's power level:
- **Level 0:** Adds a small number of babies
- **Level 1:** Adds more babies than Level 0
- **Level 2:** Adds even more babies
- **Level 3:** Adds more babies still
- **Level 4:** Adds the maximum number of babies

### Important Limits

- **Maximum Babies:** There is a cap on how many babies can be carried at once
- **Can't Exceed Cap:** Baby Duplication potions cannot add more babies than the maximum allowed
- **Example:** If a mother is already carrying the maximum number, the potion has no additional effect

### Physical Changes

When the number of babies increases significantly, the mother's pregnancy stage may visually advance to match the new baby count, causing them to appear more pregnant.

### Who Uses It

- Fertility Witches throw this potion (10% of the time)
- Can be brewed through the alchemy system
- Useful for those wanting larger pregnancies

### Effects on Body

- Increases apparent pregnancy size and appearance
- More baby movement and activity
- Longer pregnancy duration to accommodate more babies

## Eternal Pregnancy Potion

### What It Does

The Eternal Pregnancy potion is the rarest and most powerful potion in the mod. It prevents a pregnant entity from ever giving birth, essentially creating an everlasting pregnancy.

### Rarity

- **Extremely Rare:** Only drops from defeated Fertility Witches when killed by a player
- **Special Status:** This potion cannot be obtained through normal brewing
- **Unique Properties:** Prevents most other pregnancy effects from overriding it

### How It Works

**Effect Type:** Permanent status effect

**Permanence:** Once applied, the pregnancy becomes eternal:
- Birth will never occur naturally
- The entity remains pregnant indefinitely
- Other pregnancy-affecting potions cannot override this effect

### Protection

Entities with Eternal Pregnancy status:
- Cannot be affected by Pregnancy Delay potions
- Cannot be affected by Pregnancy Acceleration potions
- Maintain their pregnant state continuously

### Notable Features

- Has a distinctive color or appearance to show its special nature
- Marks an entity as permanently pregnant
- One of the most unusual and powerful effects in the mod

### Who Would Use It?

- Players seeking unusual gameplay experiences
- Those wanting to maintain pregnancy indefinitely
- Collectors of rare items

---

## Sound Effects

All instant pregnancy potions (Delay, Acceleration, and Duplication) trigger:
- **Stomach Growl Sounds** - A realistic stomach sound effect plays when the potion is applied
- **Varied Sounds** - The mod includes multiple different stomach growl sound variants for immersion

---

## Obtaining These Potions

### From the Fertility Witch

The witch drops these potions when defeated:
- **Common drops (2 guaranteed):** Level 0 versions of most potions
- **Rare drops (if killed by player):** Level 4 versions and Eternal Pregnancy potion

### Through Alchemy Brewing

Most potions (except Eternal Pregnancy) can be brewed through the alchemy system:
- See the Impregnation Potion Recipes Guide for brewing instructions
- Various ingredients combine to create different potion types and levels

### In the World

Some potions may be found in other locations throughout the mod as loot or rewards.

---

## Immunity Effects

### Eternal Pregnancy Protection

Entities with the Eternal Pregnancy effect are immune to:
- Pregnancy Delay potions
- Pregnancy Acceleration potions
- Other pregnancy-modifying effects

This ensures that once Eternal Pregnancy is active, nothing can change the pregnancy state.

---

## Amplifier Levels

Most pregnancy potions have amplifier levels that increase their potency:

- **Amplifier Level I (Base):** Standard effect
- **Amplifier Level II:** Stronger effect (more days added/removed, more babies duplicated)
- **Amplifier Level III+:** Even stronger effects

Higher amplifier levels result in more pronounced changes to the pregnancy.
