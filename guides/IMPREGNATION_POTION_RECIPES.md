# Impregnation Potion Brewing Recipes

This guide explains how to brew all types of Impregnation Potions and related potions using a brewing stand.

## Overview

The Alchemy system contains several brewing recipe types that create different variants of potions:

1. **Base Impregnation Potions** - The foundation potions created from Regeneration Potions
2. **Species-Specific Impregnation Potions** - Advanced variants for different creature types
3. **Pregnancy Healing Potion** - A special healing potion for pregnant entities

All recipes work with regular potions, splash potions, and lingering potions. The type of input potion is preserved in the output.

## Important Notes

- **Owner Data Transfer:** When brewing with Cum Specimen Tubes, special data about the owner is transferred to the resulting potion, though this feature is currently under development and has no effect yet.
- **Potion Types:** All recipes preserve the input potion type (regular, splash, or lingering) in the output.
- **Sequential Process:** Base impregnation potions must be progressed sequentially from Level 0 to 4.
- **Species Conversions:** Once you have the desired level of base impregnation potion, you can convert it directly to any species-specific variant of the same level.
- **Randomized Variants:** Creeper and Ender impregnation potions randomly produce either standard or humanoid variants.
