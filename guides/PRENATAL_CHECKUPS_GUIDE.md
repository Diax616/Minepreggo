## Who Offers Prenatal Checkups?

### Service Providers

Prenatal checkups are offered by two types of NPCs:

1. **Villagers** - Only villagers with the "Doctor" job can only provide this prenatal care service to players. They do not appear naturally; the player must assign them the job using the "Medical Table" block.

2. **Scientific Illagers** - These special illagers offer prenatal checkup services to both players and pregnant mobs.

## Types of Prenatal Checkups

There are three different types of prenatal checkups available, each providing different information and services:

### 1. Regular Checkup

**Cost:** 20 Emeralds (Base Price) 
**Available During:** Pregnancy Phase 1 and later  
**Description:** A standard prenatal checkup to monitor the health and development of the pregnancy

This is the basic prenatal checkup option, available early in pregnancy. It provides fundamental information about the pregnancy status.

---

### 2. Ultrasound Scan

**Cost:** 25 Emeralds (Base Price)   
**Available During:** Pregnancy Phase 2 and later  
**Description:** An advanced imaging scan to examine babies in the womb.

This checkup becomes available once the pregnancy reaches Phase 2. It provides more detailed information through an ultrasound examination.

---

### 3. Paternity Test

**Cost:** 30 Emeralds (Base Price)  
**Available During:** Pregnancy Phase 2 and later  
**Description:** A test to determine the biological father of the pregnancy

This advanced test becomes available during Phase 2 of pregnancy. It can identify the biological parent of the developing offspring.

---

## Important Information

### Payment Method

All prenatal checkups must be paid for using **Emeralds**. You need to have enough emeralds in your inventory to afford the checkup you wish to receive.

### Pregnancy Phases

Not all checkups are available during all stages of pregnancy. Certain checkups require the pregnancy to progress to specific phases:

- **Regular Checkup:** Available from Phase 1 onwards
- **Ultrasound Scan:** Available from Phase 2 onwards
- **Paternity Test:** Available from Phase 2 onwards

### Checkup Results

Each type of checkup provides different outputs or information about the pregnancy. These results may be given as items or displayed information about the pregnancy status.

## Tips

- **Plan ahead:** Make sure you have enough emeralds before visiting an NPC for checkups
- **Timing:** Some checkups only become available once your pregnancy progresses to Phase 2, so you may need to wait before accessing all checkup types
- **Which provider?** Both Villagers and Scientific Illagers offer the same services, so choose whichever is most convenient to reach
- **Mob checkups:** If you have pregnant mobs, you'll need a Scientific Illager for their checkups (Villagers don't serve mobs)
