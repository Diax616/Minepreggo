# Interspecies Pregnancy Guide (AI-generated content)

This guide explains interspecies pregnancies in the Minepreggo mod, including the unique effects that occur when a player carries offspring from different creature species, and what happens if the pregnant mother dies.

---

## Overview

Interspecies pregnancies occur when a player (only female players) becomes pregnant with offspring from a non-human species. Rather than carrying human babies, the mother carries creature offspring from zombies, creepers, or Endermen. These pregnancies bring unique and sometimes dangerous effects as the pregnancy progresses.

### Valid Targets

Only **player characters** can experience interspecies pregnancies. Pregnant mobs and other creatures do not experience these special effects.

### Prerequisites

Interspecies pregnancy effects activate from **Phase 3 (P3) onwards**. Before reaching Phase 3, pregnant players do not experience the species-specific effects, regardless of which creatures they are carrying.

## Interspecies Pregnancy Effects

### Species-Specific Effects

#### Full of Zombies

**Activation:** Phase 3 or later, carrying zombie offspring  
**Effect Type:** Harmful  
**Visual Color:** Greenish hue

**Symptoms:**
- Mother becomes sensitive to daylight like a zombie
- Burns in direct sunlight during the day
- Only affects players without a helmet equipped
- Burns trigger when conditions are met:
  - It is daytime in the world
  - The mother is not in water, rain, powder snow, or bubble columns
  - The mother is exposed to the sky
  - Light level is high enough (above 0.5 brightness)

**Protective Measures:**
- Wear a helmet or head armor
- Stay indoors or underground during the day
- Find shade or cover
- Swim or stand in water
- Stay in caves or enclosed areas

**Danger Level:** Moderate - The fire damage can be managed with armor

---

#### Full of Creepers

**Activation:** Phase 3 or later, carrying creeper offspring  
**Effect Type:** Harmful  
**Visual Color:** Greenish

**Symptoms:**
- Mother becomes unstable and volatile, similar to creepers
- In Phase 3 (P3) specifically: If the mother dies, an explosion occurs at the location of death
- The explosion scale increases based on how advanced the pregnancy is

**Explosive Potential at Death:**
- **Phase 3:** The explosion level scales with the pregnancy phase
- **Higher phases:** Larger and more destructive explosions
- **Location:** Explosion occurs at the mother's position when she dies
- **Destructive:** Can damage terrain and nearby entities

**Protective Measures:**
- Avoid dangerous situations where death is likely
- Be careful with your health management
- Keep distance from valuable structures if pregnancy is advanced
- Use death prevention methods (totem of undying, etc.)
- Be aware of your environment before engaging in combat

**Important Note:** The explosion only occurs in Phase 3 or later. Younger pregnancies with creepers do not cause explosions upon maternal death.

**Danger Level:** High - Can destroy significant areas if death occurs in late pregnancy

---

#### Full of Endermen

**Activation:** Phase 3 or later, carrying Ender offspring  
**Effect Type:** Harmful  
**Visual Color:** Purple/dark hue

**Symptoms:**
- Mother becomes unstable in spacetime, like an Enderman
- Experiences random teleportation
- Teleportation frequency increases with:
  - Advancement of pregnancy phase
  - Number of Ender babies being carried

**Teleportation Mechanics:**
- **Frequency:** Increases as pregnancy progresses and more babies are present
- **Distance:** Teleports to random locations within ~16 blocks away
- **Vertical Range:** Can teleport up or down significantly
- **Sound Effect:** Enderman-like teleport sound plays at each location
- **Frequency Calculation:** Based on:
  - Current pregnancy phase (earlier phases = lower chance)
  - Number of Ender babies in the womb (more babies = higher chance)
  - Random probability each tick

**Practical Effects:**
- Disorienting during normal activities
- Can interrupt focused tasks
- Can trigger fall damage or environment hazards
- Makes mining/building risky
- Can separate you from your group
- Creates confusion and disorientation

**Protective Measures:**
- Stay in safe, enclosed areas
- Avoid dangerous heights
- Don't carry valuable items when teleportation is expected
- Prepare for sudden location changes
- Use blocks or structures to limit teleportation range impact

**Danger Level:** Moderate to High - Can cause death through environmental hazards (falls, lava, etc.)

## Death Consequences

### What Happens When a Pregnant Mother Dies

When a pregnant player dies, several important things occur:

#### Spawning Offspring

Regardless of species, babies or fetuses spawn at the mother's death location:

**Phase 3 or Later:**
- Babies have a chance to be born alive
- Some may be stillborn
- Spawn chance is based on:
  - How advanced the pregnancy is
  - Random probability (60% alive, 30% chance for various outcomes, 15% other)
  - Total number of babies being carried

**Before Phase 3:**
- Only fetuses spawn (not yet viable)
- Higher chance of stillbirth
- 75% viability rate for fetuses

**Spawn Location:** Offspring spawn at the exact location where the mother died

**Quantity:** All babies/fetuses in the womb spawn at once

#### Creeper-Specific Explosive Death

**When:** Only if mother is in Phase 4 (P4) or later

**What Happens:**
1. Explosion occurs at death location
2. Explosion scale increases with pregnancy advancement
3. Later phases = larger explosions
4. Can destroy significant terrain
5. Can kill spawning babies/offspring

**Implications:**
- Creeper pregnancies in Phase 4+ are extremely dangerous if death occurs
- The explosive death may prevent babies from surviving
- Valuable structures can be destroyed
- The mother's body and equipment are also destroyed in the blast

#### Full Item Loss

- All inventory items are lost
- All equipment is lost (except what's in specific storage)
- Drops may be destroyed by creeper explosions

### Timeline of Species Effects

| Phase | Zombie Effect | Creeper Effect | Ender Effect | Notes |
|-------|---------------|----------------|--------------|-------|
| P1 | None | None | None | Effects not yet active |
| P2 | None | None | None | Effects not yet active |
| P3 | Active (daylight sensitivity) | Active (unstable) | Active (teleportation) | Species effects begin |
| P4 | Active (daylight sensitivity) | Active (explosive on death) | Active (teleportation) | Creeper explosion becomes lethal |
| P5+ | Active (daylight sensitivity) | Active (explosive on death) | Active (teleportation) | All effects continue, intensity increases |

## Gameplay Strategies for Interspecies Pregnancies

### For Zombie Pregnancies

1. **Plan activities around daylight** - Do nighttime activities when possible
2. **Maintain helmet** - Always wear head armor
3. **Prepare shelter** - Have safe indoor areas
4. **Underground colonies** - Consider living underground during later phases

### For Creeper Pregnancies

1. **Avoid combat in Phase 4+** - Death is extremely dangerous
2. **Use totem of undying** - Prevents the explosion from occurring
3. **Keep distance from structures** - If danger approaches, move away from buildings
4. **Never venture alone in Phase 4+** - Have recovery options if things go wrong
5. **Prepare for birth** - Know where a safe birth location will be

### For Ender Pregnancies

1. **Prepare for disorientation** - Expect random teleports
2. **Avoid dangerous areas** - Don't be near cliffs, lava, or water during active phases
3. **Mark safe locations** - Know where you can safely teleport within
4. **Don't carry valuables** - Transport important items separately
5. **Team up** - Having companions helps with navigation after teleports

### General Strategies

1. **Track pregnancy phase** - Know when you reach Phase 3
2. **Reduce baby count if needed** - Having fewer babies reduces effect intensity
3. **Plan pregnancies carefully** - Choose your locations and activities accordingly
4. **Birth preparation** - Have a safe area ready for when birth approaches
5. **Accept the challenge** - Interspecies pregnancies are meant to be difficult

## Detailed Teleportation Formula (Ender Pregnancies)

### Probability Calculation

The chance of teleportation is calculated as:

```
Teleportation Probability = (Pregnancy Phase Progress) × (Baby Count Factor)
```

Where:
- **Pregnancy Phase Progress:** 0 in Phase 1, increases to 1.0 by final phase
- **Baby Count Factor:** Number of Ender babies ÷ Maximum possible babies

Example:
- Phase 3 (early phase, ~40% progress) with 4 Ender babies out of 8 max
- Probability = 0.40 × 0.50 = 0.20 or 20% chance per tick

This means:
- Early pregnancies have low teleport chance
- Later pregnancies have higher teleport chance
- More Ender babies = more frequent teleports
- Single baby = minimal teleportation
- Full womb = maximum teleportation

## Effect Immunity and Removal

### Cannot Be Removed By

- Milk consumption
- Potion effects
- Healing items
- Other antidotes

These effects are intrinsic to the pregnancy and cannot be cured until the pregnancy ends (through birth or other means).

### Removed By

- Completing the pregnancy (giving birth)
- Miscarriage (if applicable)
- Using commands to remove pregnancy (if available)
