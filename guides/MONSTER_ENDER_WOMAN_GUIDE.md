# Monster Ender Woman Guide (AI-generated content)

*A comprehensive guide to taming, caring for, and utilizing your Monster Ender Woman companion*

## Introduction

Monster Ender Women are powerful, intelligent companions from the End dimension. When tamed, they become loyal allies capable of combat, transportation, and teleportation. They're taller, stronger, and more resilient than regular mobs, making them excellent companions for adventuring.

**What Makes Them Special:**
- Can be ridden like a horse
- Teleport with you across distances
- Defend you in combat
- Carry items in their inventory
- Can become pregnant and produce offspring
- Intelligent AI that responds to your care

## Types of Monster Ender Women

There are **two main types** of Monster Ender Women you'll encounter:

### 1. Wild Monster Ender Woman
- **Cannot be tamed**
- Spawns naturally in the End
- Hostile if provoked (looking at them)
- Neutral otherwise
- Drops experience when defeated

### 2. Tamable Monster Ender Woman
- **Can be tamed by players**
- Requires specific food items
- Once tamed, becomes loyal companion
- Retains all abilities after taming
- This is the type you want to find!

**How to Tell Them Apart:**
Try feeding them Refined Chorus Shards or Ender Slime Jelly. If hearts appear (even if taming fails), it's tamable. If nothing happens, it's wild and cannot be tamed.

## How to Tame

Taming a Monster Ender Woman requires patience and the right food.

### Taming Items

You can tame with **two items**:

1. **Refined Chorus Shards** (Recommended)
   - Crafted from chorus fruit
   - Check crafting recipes for details

2. **Ender Slime Jelly**
   - Provides 6 nutrition
   - Also used for feeding after taming

### Taming Process

**Step 1: Find a Tamable Monster Ender Woman**
- Look for Monster Ender Women in the End, Overworld or the nether.
- Approach carefully—avoid eye contact initially

**Step 2: Feed the Taming Item**
- Hold Refined Chorus Shards or Ender Slime Jelly
- Right-click the Ender Woman
- Watch for particle effects

**Step 3: Wait for Success**
- **Hearts = SUCCESS!** She's now tamed
- **Smoke = Not yet...** Try again
- Each feeding has a **33% chance** to succeed
- May take 2-5 feedings on average

**Step 4: Post-Taming**
- She immediately becomes friendly (savage state removed)
- Her fullness is set to 12
- She'll follow you and defend you
- You can now ride her and access her inventory

**Tips:**
- Bring 10+ taming items to ensure success
- Tame in a safe, enclosed area
- Don't attack her during taming attempts
- She won't despawn once tamed

## Food and Nutrition

After taming, your Ender Woman needs regular feeding to stay healthy and obedient.

### Accepted Foods

Your Ender Woman can eat any **Ender Food**:

| Food Item | Nutrition | Notes |
|-----------|-----------|-------|
| **Ender Slime Jelly** | 6 | Best general food |
| Ender Slime Jelly with Chocolate | 6+ | Enhanced variant |
| Ender Slime Jelly with Hot Sauce | 6+ | Enhanced variant |
| Ender Slime Jelly with Salt | 6+ | Enhanced variant |
| Sour Ender Slime Jelly | 6+ | Enhanced variant |
| **Refined Chorus Shards** | Varies | Also used for taming |
| Chorus Fruit | 4 | Basic food |
| Chorus Fruit with Chocolate | 4+ | Enhanced variant |
| Chorus Fruit with Hot Sauce | 4+ | Enhanced variant |
| Chorus Fruit with Salt | 4+ | Enhanced variant |
| Sour Chorus Fruit | 4+ | Enhanced variant |

### Feeding Mechanics

**How to Feed:**
1. Hold food in your main hand
2. Right-click your tamed Ender Woman
3. She eats the food and gains nutrition
4. Hearts appear if fullness increases

**What Happens:**
- Fullness increases by food's nutrition value
- Maximum fullness is **20**
- Feeding when already at 20 does nothing
- Each food item is consumed on feeding

---

## Fullness and Hunger System

Your Ender Woman has a **fullness meter** (0-20) that constantly decreases. Maintaining it is crucial!

### Fullness Levels Explained

| Fullness | State | Behavior |
|----------|-------|----------|
| **12-20** | **Happy** | Follows, obeys, fights for you, can be ridden |
| **5-11** | **Neutral** | Still obedient but needs food soon |
| **1-4** | **Angry** | Irritable, might attack once after 100 ticks |
| **0** | **Savage** | Refuses commands, defensive only |

### How Fullness Decreases

**Passive Drain:**
- Decreases by **1** every configured interval (see server config)
- Drains faster when active

**Movement Penalties:**
- Walking/Running: +1 tick acceleration toward hunger
- Swimming: +3 tick acceleration (very hungry!)

**Example:**
- Standing still: Normal drain
- Running around: Loses fullness ~2x faster
- Swimming in water: Loses fullness ~4x faster

### Emotional States

#### **Angry State (Fullness 1-4)**
- Triggers after 100 ticks of low fullness
- **Might attack owner once**, then immediately stops
- Target resets after hitting you
- Still follows and defends you from enemies
- **Recovery:** Feed to 5+ fullness

#### **Savage State (Fullness 0)**
- Refuses to follow commands
- Won't attack enemies for you
- Cannot open inventory GUI
- **Does NOT attack unless you hit her first** (defensive only)
- Teleports randomly like wild Endermen
- **Recovery:** Feed to 12+ fullness, she immediately obeys again

**Important:** Savage state is **safe to recover from**! Just approach peacefully and right-click with food. Don't attack her.

### Health Regeneration

When fullness is **16 or higher**:
- Heals **1 HP every 20 ticks** (1 second)
- Costs 1 fullness per heal
- Automatic—no action needed
- Stops when health is full or fullness drops below 16

**Strategy:** Keep fullness at 16+ to maintain her health passively!

## Riding Your Ender Woman

One of the most useful features is **riding** your Ender Woman like a mount!

### Riding Mechanics

**Movement:**
- Speed: 50% of her base movement speed
- Can climb 1-block obstacles automatically

- Teleportation transportation (see below)
- Looks awesome

---

## Teleportation System (Key 'U' by default)

The **most powerful ability**: teleporting together across large distances!

### How Teleportation Works

Your tamed Ender Woman can teleport **with you** to locations you target.

**Requirements:**
- She must be tamed by you
- Not aggressive
- Not in waiting mode
- Either **within 2 blocks** OR **you're riding her**
- If pregnant: Not incapacitated

### Using Teleportation

**Method varies by mod implementation**, but generally:
1. Look at your destination
2. Use the teleportation keybind or item
3. Both you and your Ender Woman teleport together
4. Makes Enderman teleport sound

**If Riding:**
- You both teleport as one unit
- Land at destination together
- No separation risk

**If Not Riding:**
- Must be within 4 blocks of her
- Both teleport independently to target
- She appears nearby at destination

### Teleportation Range

- Short range: Up to 50 blocks reliably
- Long range: Check mod configuration
- Cannot teleport across dimensions

### When Teleportation Fails

She **cannot teleport with you** if:
- She's aggressive or in combat
- She's in waiting mode
- You're too far away (>2 blocks) and not riding
- She's incapacitated by pregnancy pain
- She's damaged by pregnancy-specific damage

**Solution:** Mount her or move closer before teleporting!

## Inventory Management

Your Ender Woman has a **10-slot inventory** for carrying items.

### Inventory Slots

- **HEAD:** Helmet/headwear
- **MAINHAND:** Held item
- **OFFHAND:** Shield or item
- **FOOD:** Dedicated food storage
- **BOTH_HANDS:** Usable by either hand
- **10 additional slots:** General storage

### Accessing Inventory

1. Right-click your tamed Ender Woman with empty hand
2. If fullness > 0 (not savage), inventory GUI opens
3. Place/remove items as needed
4. Close GUI when done

**Note:** Cannot access inventory when she's savage!

## Frequently Asked Questions

### General Questions

**Q: How do I know if an Ender Woman is tamable?**

### Pregnancy Questions

**Q: Can she become pregnant?**  
A: Yes, tamed Ender Women can become pregnant through player interaction.

**Q: How does pregnancy affect her abilities?**  
A: She can still fight, follow, and teleport, but some pregnancy pains temporarily disable riding/teleportation. She's also hungrier.

A: Only if you attack her first. Savage mobs are defensive, not aggressive. Approach peacefully and feed to recover.

**Q: Why does she teleport randomly?**

A: Yes, like Endermen. Avoid rain and keep her away from water sources. She'll teleport away from water damage.

**Q: Can she wear armor?**  
A: Yes! Place a helmet in her HEAD slot for protection. Armor reduces damage taken.

**Q: What happens if she dies?**  
A: She dies permanently and drops her inventory contents and experience. There is no respawn mechanic—protect her carefully!

### Troubleshooting

**Q: My Ender Woman won't eat food!**

**Q: I can't open her inventory!**  
A: She might be savage. Feed her to 12+ fullness first to restore access.

**Q: She disappeared after I logged out!**  
A: Tamed mobs should persist. Check if: (1) She was actually tamed (hearts appeared), (2) She died while you were away, (3) Server issue requiring investigation.

**Q: She won't teleport to me!**  
A: Tamed Ender Women follow you normally. If you want HER to teleport WITH YOU, see Teleportation System section.
