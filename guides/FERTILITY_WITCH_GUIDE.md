# Fertility Witch Guide

This guide explains the Fertility Witch entity, including the potions it throws, how it attracts mobs, and the valuable loot it drops upon defeat.

## Overview

The Fertility Witch is a dangerous hostile mob that specializes in pregnancy-related potions and effects. It behaves similarly to regular witches but has adapted to throw specialized potions related to fertility and pregnancy. These witches actively seek out pregnant entities and impregnate non-pregnant ones.

## Appearance and Basic Behavior

The Fertility Witch is a variant of the regular Minecraft witch with special abilities:

- **Cannot join raids** - Unlike regular witches, Fertility Witches will not participate in raids against villages
- **No XP reward** - Defeating a Fertility Witch provides no experience points
- **Higher step height** - Can climb up steep terrain more easily
- **Ranged attacker** - Throws potions at targets from a distance

## Combat Behavior

### Potion Throwing Mechanics

The Fertility Witch uses a sophisticated system to decide which potion to throw:

#### Against Friendly Entities (Raiders)
- If the target is injured (health ≤ 6 hearts), throws **Healing Potions**
- If the target is healthy, throws **Regeneration Potions**
- Will disengage after healing the target

#### Against Standard Enemies
- High health targets: **Poison Potion** (8+ hearts)
- Nearby targets: **Weakness Potion** (within 3 blocks, 25% chance)
