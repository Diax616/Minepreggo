# Villager Pregnancy Guide

This guide explains how players become pregnant by villagers, the benefits and mechanics of villager pregnancies, and how to spawn baby villagers from the "Baby Villager" item obtained after giving birth.

## Overview

Villagers can impregnate female players through a special mechanic involving food sharing and attraction. Unlike monster impregnations which occur through potions, villager impregnation is a natural breeding process that uses the normal Minecraft villager breeding mechanics modified for pregnancy.

### Unique Characteristics

- **Only valid for players** - Villagers will only breed with female players
- **Natural breeding method** - Uses villager food and beds instead of potions
- **Humanoid offspring** - Babies can be villagers or humans
- **Tied to villager mechanics** - Requires beds, professions, and village structures

## How Players Become Pregnant by Villagers

### Step 1: Drop Villager Foods

**Compatible Foods:**
- Bread
- Potatoes
- Carrots
- Beetroot (beets)

**How It Works:**
1. Drop any of these foods on the ground while **not pregnant and not in post-pregnancy phase**
2. The food gets tagged with your UUID
3. Nearby villagers will detect this food as coming from you

### Step 2: Villager Attraction

**Requirements for Villagers:**
- Must have a profession (not "None")
- Must be able to breed
- Must have access to enough beds (at least 1 bed within 8 blocks)
- Must be within 25 blocks of the player

**When a villager picks up tagged food:**
1. The villager begins moving toward the player
2. Heart particles appear around both the player and villager
3. The villager is attracted to you and begins the breeding sequence

### Step 3: The Breeding Sequence

**Animation and Particles:**
- Both player and villager display heart particle effects
- A cinematic sequence begins (if the mod has cinematics enabled)
- The villager becomes temporarily unavailable for other interactions

**Success Conditions:**
- Player must have sufficient fertility rate
- Villager must complete the full sequence
- Number of babies is calculated based on:
  - Player's current fertility rate
  - Random chance (similar to normal villager breeding)
  - Can result in 0-5 babies potentially

**After Successful Breeding:**
- Player becomes pregnant with villager babies
- Villager fertility is reset
- Pre-Pregnancy phase starts

### Breeding Blockers

The following situations **prevent villager impregnation:**

1. **Player is already pregnant** - No breeding while pregnant
2. **Player is in post-pregnancy phase** - Must wait until postpartum period ends
3. **Villager has no profession** - Unemployed villagers cannot breed
4. **Insufficient beds** - Need at least 1 bed within 8 blocks
5. **No food picked up** - Food must be dropped (tagged) first
6. **Player too far away** - Must be within 25 blocks
7. **Low fertility rate** - Player must have enough fertility to conceive
8. **Villager cannot breed** - Some villagers have breeding restrictions

## Benefits of Villager Pregnancies

### Advantages Over Other Species

#### Peaceful Gameplay
- No threat from the father (villagers are peaceful)
- No special pregnancy effects (no Full of Zombies, etc.)
- No explosive births or teleportation issues
- Can manage pregnancy like normal activities

#### Natural Mechanics
- Uses existing Minecraft systems (beds, food, villages)
- Fits naturally into village expansion
- Non-hostile to the player
- Can integrate with village structure

#### Offspring Utility
- Baby villagers grow into adult villagers
- Can be used to expand or establish villages
- Can be guided to new locations
- Can develop into specific professions

#### No Dangerous Effects
- Cannot cause explosions on death
- No daylight sensitivity
- No random teleportation
- Safe to manage during all phases

### Gameplay Integration

**Village Building:**
- Expand existing villages by breeding villagers
- Create new villages in desired locations
- Control villager population and professions

**Trading Network:**
- Grow your own villagers with desired professions
- Build trading posts by establishing villager communities
- Expand resource acquisition capabilities

**Long-term Planning:**
- Plan pregnancies strategically
- Coordinate multiple pregnancies for village growth
- Integrate family building with base expansion

#### Trading Discounts from the Father Villager

One of the most valuable benefits of villager pregnancies is the trading discount you receive from the father villager:

**After Successful Breeding:**
- The father villager gains **25 Major Positive reputation gossip** with you
- This reputation is permanent and persists between sessions

**When You Become Pregnant:**
- If the father villager recognizes you are pregnant (you interact with them after becoming pregnant)
- The villager gains an additional **50 Major Positive reputation gossip**
- This bonus reputation further increases the discount

**Trading Price Reduction:**
- In Minecraft, villager reputation affects trading prices
- **Major Positive gossip significantly reduces prices**
- With high reputation, you receive discounts on all the villager's trades
- The more reputation accumulated, the better the discount

**Cumulative Benefits:**
- If you breed with the same villager multiple times, reputation stacks
- Each pregnancy adds to the villager's positive feelings
- Can result in extremely cheap trades over time
- Creates a lasting economic advantage

**Example Scenario:**
1. You breed with a Librarian villager (25 reputation)
2. You become pregnant and interact with them (+ 50 reputation = 75 total)
3. This villager now sells books at significantly reduced prices
4. If you breed again later, reputation stacks even higher
5. The same villager becomes your best trading partner

**Strategic Use:**
- Breed with Librarians to get discounted enchanted books
- Breed with Clerics for cheap brewing materials
- Breed with Farmers for discounted crops
- Build a reputation network of cheap-trading villagers
- Each pregnancy strengthens your economic advantages

**Why This Matters:**
- Provides economic rewards for pregnancies
- Makes the father villager valuable beyond just breeding
- Creates incentive to breed with specific profession villagers
- Integrates pregnancy mechanics into trading networks
- Makes village economics more interactive

## The Baby Villager Item

### What It Is

**Baby Villager Item:**
- Uncommon rarity item
- Non-stackable (stack size of 1)
- Obtained after giving birth to villager offspring
- Represents a newborn villager in item form

### Obtaining Baby Villager Items

**When Giving Birth:**
- Mother gives birth to alive babies (if advanced enough in pregnancy)
- Each baby manifests as a **Baby Villager Item**
- Items drop at birth location or in inventory
- Multiple births = Multiple baby villager items

**Items Received:**
- One "Baby Villager" item per offspring
- Items are in your inventory or dropped nearby
- Can be collected and transported

### Spawning Baby Villagers

#### Using the Baby Villager Item

**To Spawn a Baby Villager:**
1. Hold the Baby Villager item in your main hand
2. Right-click on any villager (adult)
3. A baby villager spawns at the location
4. The Baby Villager item is consumed

**Spawn Details:**
- Baby villager spawns at the clicked villager's location
- Baby is automatically set to baby status
- Baby grows into adult over time (20 minutes in Minecraft)
- Baby inherits some characteristics based on parent villager

#### Spawning Multiple Babies

If you have multiple Baby Villager items:
1. Each item can be used to spawn one baby
2. You can spawn all babies at once or separately
3. Right-click different villagers with each item
4. Or right-click the same villager multiple times

#### Best Practices for Spawning

**Location Selection:**
- Spawn babies where you want them to settle
- Near beds if you want them to stay in one area
- Close to a workstation if you want them to take professions
- In a safe area away from mobs

**Management:**
- Spawn all at once for easier tracking
- Give them time to grow
- Provide beds for them to settle
- Place workstations for profession development

### Baby Villager Growth

**Growth Timeline:**
- Takes 20 minutes (full Minecraft day cycle)
- Cannot be accelerated
- Growth is automatic once spawned

**After Growing:**
- Becomes an adult villager
- Profession determined randomly or by workstations
- Can be traded with (after profession development)
- Can breed with other villagers

## Pregnancy Characteristics

### Pregnancy Duration

**Standard Timeline:**
- Follows normal pregnancy phase progression (P0-P8)
- Standard pregnancy length (configurable, typically several Minecraft days)
- Completes like any other pregnancy

**No Special Phase Effects:**
- No mobility penalties
- No armor restrictions
- No environmental effects
- Can engage in normal activities

### Villager Father Mechanics

**The Father Villager:**
- Initially tracked with UUID
- Returns to normal villager behavior after breeding
- Does NOT follow you around
- Can breed with other villagers
- Can die (baby is still born normally)

**Multiple Fathers:**
- Each pregnancy can be from a different villager
- Father identity is stored with baby data
- No genetic inheritance system
- All babies are treated equally

## Spawning Babies from Multiple Sources

### Scenario: Mixed Species Pregnancy

While the normal villager pregnancy only produces villagers, you could theoretically have other species in a mixed pregnancy. However:
- Each "Baby" item type corresponds to its species
- Baby Villager items only spawn baby villagers
- Other species have their own baby items

### Using Baby Items

**To Spawn Any Baby:**
1. Hold the appropriate baby item
2. Right-click on a representative adult of that species (or use in world)
3. Baby spawns at that location

**For Villagers Specifically:**
- Right-click on any villager to spawn a baby villager
- Baby appears at villager's location

### Combining Baby Types

If you have multiple baby items from different species pregnancies:
- Spawn them in the same location to create diverse offspring groups
- Each baby grows independently
- They coexist peacefully
- Can be managed together

---

## Storage and Transport

### Before Spawning

**Storage Options:**
- Keep baby items in inventory
- Store in chests or containers
- Carry multiple items for batch spawning
- Baby items are non-stackable (each takes 1 slot)

**Transportation:**
- Baby items don't decay
- Won't despawn if left on ground
- Can be transported long distances
- Place in shulker boxes for organization

### Long-term Storage

**If You Want to Delay Spawning:**
1. Keep baby items in storage
2. Retrieve them when ready
3. Transport to desired spawning location
4. Spawn when needed

**Planning Ahead:**
- Complete pregnancy → get baby items
- Store until you're ready for village expansion
- Spawn all at once when convenient
- Grow and develop babies into useful villagers
