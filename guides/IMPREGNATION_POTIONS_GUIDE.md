# Impregnation Potions - Complete Guide

## Overview

Impregnation potions are special drinkable items in the Minepreggo mod that instantly trigger pregnancy in the player or mob that drinks them. Unlike waiting for natural pregnancy triggers, these potions provide immediate and reliable pregnancy initiation. Each potion has different effects depending on its strength level and the type of species it's designed for.

## How Impregnation Potions Work

### Basic Mechanics

1. **Drinking the Potion**
   - Player or mob consumes an impregnation potion
   - The potion applies an invisible effect to the drinker for approximately 15 seconds (300 ticks)
   - This duration allows the potion effect to naturally expire

2. **Natural Expiration (Key Trigger)**
   - When the potion effect expires naturally after 15 seconds, it triggers pregnancy
   - **Important:** If the effect is removed before expiring (milk effect, removed manually, etc.), pregnancy will NOT occur
   - Only natural expiration counts!

3. **Impregnation Occurs**
   - Upon natural expiration, the entity is impregnated based on the potion's strength level
   - The drinker immediately enters the Pre-Pregnancy phase
   - Number of babies depends on the potion's amplifier level

## Strength Levels and Baby Count

The potion's amplifier level determines how many babies will be born:

| Level | Amplifier | Babies | Pregnancy Will End At Stage |
|-------|-----------|--------|---------------------------|
| 0     | 0         | 1 baby | P4 (Early birth stage) |
| 1     | 1         | 2 babies | P5 |
| 2     | 2         | 3 babies | P6 |
| 3     | 3         | 4 babies | P7 |
| 4     | 4         | 5+ babies | P8 (Full term) |

**Note:** The pregnancy progresses to the minimum stage needed based on the number of babies. More babies = longer pregnancy = more advanced stage before birth.

## Potion Colors and Identification

- **Zombie Impregnation:** Green hue
- **Creeper Impregnation:** Greenish tint
- **Humanoid Creeper Impregnation:** Green with humanoid tint

## Technical Notes

### Effect Duration
- All impregnation potions have a 15-second (300 tick) duration
- Effect is hidden: `false` in visibility
- Effect is ambient: `true` (no particle effect shown to player)
- Amplifier is the determining factor for baby count

### Marking System
- The mod uses an internal tracking system to mark entities for impregnation
- Only entities marked for impregnation are processed when the effect expires
- If an effect is removed by other means, the mark is automatically cleared
- This prevents accidental impregnation from removed effects

### Effect Removal
- If milk is consumed during the 15-second window, the pregnancy mark is removed
- Manually removing effects will also cancel impregnation
- This gives players/admins control over whether pregnancy occurs

### Species-Specific vs. General Potion
- **General Impregnation Potion:** Uses the mother's species to determine baby type
  - Perfect for maintaining breed purity (zombie with zombie, creeper with creeper, etc.)
  - Players always get human babies
- **Species-Specific Potions:** Override the mother's species and force a specific species
  - Used to create hybrid babies (e.g., zombie mother + creeper potion = creeper babies)
  - Allows cross-species breeding

---

## Practical Usage Tips

1. **Confirm Pregnancy:** Wait for the effect to wear off (about 15 seconds) - you'll see visual changes and messages confirming pregnancy

2. **For Pure Breed:** Use the general **Impregnation Potion** - babies will match the mother's species automatically

3. **For Mobs - Species Restriction:** Preggo mobs can ONLY use potions that match their species or the general Impregnation Potion. Using an incompatible potion will damage them instead.

4. **For Players - All Potions Compatible:** Players can use ANY potion type to get the corresponding species babies

5. **Hybrid Creation:** Hybrid babies (mixed species) can ONLY occur through natural sex events between different species, not through potions with mobs
